<h2> What is Smart Shelf? </h2>

<p> 
Smart Shelf is the new way you can keep your personal food inventory organized and easily determine what meals can
be created with the ingredients you have available.
</p>

<h2> What features are available? </h2>

<p>
Smart Shelf allows you to scan an any items from participating stores to build your inventory for personal use.
The app can then use that information to give you suggestions on what you are able to cook with your ingredients or
what you are close to being able to cook.  The meals you see can be limited by dietary restrsctions as well.
Smart Shelf also stores information on expiration dates to let you know when food items need to be used.
